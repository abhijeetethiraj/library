    <p>Friction is a force that occurs when two surfaces slide against each other, caused by the irregularities on the surfaces becoming entangled. Friction can be reduced by making surfaces smoother, using lubricants, or streamlining objects:
        Smoothing surfaces: Polishing surfaces can make them smoother, reducing friction.
        Using lubricants: Lubricants like oil, grease, or graphite can fill in gaps between surfaces, reducing friction.
        Streamlining objects: The shape of an object can affect air resistance, which can slow it down. Streamlining an object's shape, like that of a jet or bullet train, can reduce air friction.

        What are the methods of reducing friction? - BYJU'S
        When objects are rolled over the surface, the friction between the rolled object and the surface can be reduced by using ball bearings. Using lubricants such as oil or grease can reduce the friction between the surfaces. By polishing the surface, polishing makes the surface smooth and friction can be reduced.

        Definition, Types of Friction, Applications & Videos - BYJU'S
        Friction is dependent on the smoothness or roughness of the two surfaces that are in contact with each other. When the surface is smooth, the friction between the two reduces as there is not much interlocking of irregularities. While the surface is rough, friction increases. 2. On the force that is acting on these surfaces. Friction increases when the force is applied along with the irregularities. What Causes Friction? Friction is caused due to the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact. So, when one object moves over the other, these irregularities on the surface get entangled, giving rise to friction.

        Methods for Reduction friction: * Make the surfaces little more smoother. ... * Lubrication is another way to make a surface smoother. ... * Make the object more streamlined. ... * Reduce the Normal force acting between the surfaces in contact. ... * Reduce the contact between the surfaces, so that less number of bonds will be formed.

        Friction is a force - Education | vic.gov.au
        14 Nov 2018 — A useful model for explaining friction is the idea that all surfaces have tiny bumps. When two surfaces slide over one another the tiny bumps push on each other. Friction causes a force on a surface which is in the opposite direction to its motion. Friction can be reduced by the application of lubricants.

        Increasing and Decreasing Friction - Vedantu
        Friction is represented by air resistance. Moving objects are slowed by air resistance. The air resistance of an item is affected by physical features such as its form. Air friction is greatly decreased by streamlining the form of the body moving through air. Example: Jets, supercars and bullet trains have a streamlined design. Ways for Decreasing Friction. Making use of lubricants: The application of lubricants like oil, grease, or graphite reduces the roughness of the surface. Lubricants minimise friction by filling the gaps of irregularities between surfaces in contact.

    <p>In “Tales of Horror” by Nikesh Murali, readers are treated to a compelling anthology of four short stories that meticulously scrutinize the virtues and vices of humanity under extraordinary circumstances. The narratives delve deep into the recesses of the human mind, exposing the darkest desires carefully hidden away.</p>
